Use PR_hyb.recode.vcf VCF file to count reads for the "minor" allele at heterozygous sites in the two hybrids samples (16_237_021 and 16_284_032). 
Proportion of the two alleles at heterozygous sites in a first generation hybrid should be equal to 0.5. 
Generate Figure S1 reporting distribtution for this counts and stat. test for goodness of fit to expected proportions.
